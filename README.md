# Codility Training Exercise Solutions

Repo with a set of solutions for the exercises listed in the [codility programmers lessons](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/)

## Acknowledgments:
This repo was inspired by [johnmee](https://github.com/johnmee/codility), to whom I own a big thank you, overwise I would have had to actually write the unit tests by hand :) 

My solutions are often different therefore I version them here. 


## Tips: 
A couple of tips on what I learned so far: 
- codility will present you a few naive examples, be sure to include in your testing also the edge cases.
- In the file: test-input.txt you can add several examples and run your function against them, be sure to include edge cases in the test-input.txt to maxime your score. 
- Complexity matters. Expected complexity is: 

| Size of dataset | Complexity expected |
| --------------- | ------------------  |
| 1 000 000       | O(n) or O(n log n)  |
| 10 000          | O(n2)               |
| 500             | O(n3)               |

 
## Finally:
Likely if you visit this page you are preparing for an interview/s wish you luck with it, keep up the good work!
